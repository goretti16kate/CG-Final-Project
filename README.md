The script automates the exploitation of a known vulnerability on port 21 running proftpd 1.3.5. The test case was a vulnerable VM given as the first assessment in the Cybergirls Penetration and vulnerability testing career path

## Installation

To clone on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goretti16kate/CG-Final-Project
```

## Usage

The project.sh script was the presented script that was modified to be time conscious; hence, it does not include much of the enumeration code.
You may need to tinker with it to manually include the IP address of the vulnerable machine.

``` ./project.sh ```

The recon.sh includes a bit of recon and is the longer version of project.sh.

``` ./recon.sh <IP address>  ``
